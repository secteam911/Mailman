# Mailman
A simple python script to crawl a web page and find valid emails 



This script uses the api at https://mailboxlayer.com/ to validate emails so you have to create a python file called c0nf.py and put your api key in the file the following way:
    key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
save it in the same file as Mailman python script and enjoy 


Make sure you have requests , json modules installed 

How to run :
  ```python3 Mailman.py Ture```  <== creates a log file with found emails 
  ```python3 Mailman.py     ```  <== outputs the results in the terminal 
  
 have fun
